              <p>
                My journey with programming started in 2015, alongside studying
                Bioinformatics major at Wroc≈Çaw University of Environmental and
                Life Sciences.
              </p>

              <p>
                My first Hello World came from Python 2.7 console. At this very
                moment, the world of programming became wide open for me and I
                knew what I'm going to do for a living. Along the way, I got to
                learn some basics of R, C, C#, Bash, and Java.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of these languages had its perks (except C maybe ;) ) but
                it wasn't until I discovered JavaScript when I truly became
                passionate about programming and Web Development in general.
