                My journey with programming started in 2015, alongside with
                studying Bioinformatics major at Wroc≈Çaw University of
                Environmental and Life Sciences.{" "}

                My first Hello World came from Python 2.7 console. At this very
                moment the world of programming became wide open for me and I
                knew what I'm going to do for a living. Along the way I got to
                learn some basics of R, C, C#, Bash and Java.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of these languages had its perks (except C maybe ;) ) but
                it wasn't until I discovered JavaScript when I truly became
                passionate about programming and Web Development in general.{" "}
