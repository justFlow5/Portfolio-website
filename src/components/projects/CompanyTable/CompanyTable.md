#### Features

---

1. When the user enters the page it makes an initial request to the server to display the first page of results.
2. After that app makes requests to get the rest of the results. It improves UX because in order to display every result app has to make 300 requests and do math operations to calculate incomes of companies which takes a few seconds, but when the initial request is made first, results are displayed to the user almost immediately.
3. Pagination: generate page numbers based on number of results.
4. Display buttons that allow you to change how many results are displayed per page.
5. Search box which enables to find a matching company when user types at least two letters.
